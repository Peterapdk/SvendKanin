# Gemini AI Usage

Gemini is integrated in `backend/src/gemini.js`.

- Add your API key to `.env`: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Use `/api/journal` to ask for AI feedback on journal entries or tracked tasks.

Gemini is used to generate prompts/questions proactively as part of the rabbit diary experience.
